### XBee Smart Modem Socket

We've kept the XBee socket consistent with the XBee pinout, so this breakout board is backwards compatible. In order to take full advantage of this board, we recommend one of the newer Digi XBee boards. Either the [Digi XBee 3 Low-Power LTE-M/NB-IoT, GNSS, no SIM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22329) or the [Digi XBee 3 North America LTE Cat 1, 3G, GNSS, no SIM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22330).

### UART Select Switch

Disconnect the UART Lines when uploading to the R3/R4 Board. 

### 3v3 Source Selection

The 3v3 source selection switch allows the user to choose whether the XBee Shield is powered from the R3/R4 board or from the onboard USB-C. Some XBee 3 modules, namely those with GNSS and LTE capabilities, consume more power than can be provided through the R3/R4 board. Use the onboard USB-C connector in this case. 




### Buck Converter - AP63203

The AP63203 Buck Converter ensures appropriate power supply to the components of the board. VIN range is <b>3.8V-5.5V</b>. Output is 2A max.

### Qwiic Connector

The Qwiic connector on the SparkFun XBee Arduino Shield provides power and I<sup>2</sup>C connectivity to Qwiic breakout boards.

### Buttons

There are two buttons - D0 and RST. Reset allows you to reset the board without unplugging, the D0 button is provided for user-defined functionality. 



### LEDs

There are three LEDs on the board:

</figure>

#### PWR

This LED lights up when power is provided to the board. 

####ASC
This LED on the development board blinks when the XBee is registered to the cellular network.

| Blink | Timing | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| On | Solid | Not joined to a mobile network |
| Double Blink | Â½ second | The last TCP/UDP/SMS attempt failed. If the LED has this pattern, you may need to check DI (Remote Manager Indicator) or CI (Protocol/Connection Indication) for the cause of the error. | 
| Single blink | 1 Second | Normal Operation |


#### RSSI 
This LED is the Received Signal Strength Indicator. When configured, it reflects the received signal strength.

RSSI PWM
The RSSI/PWM output is enabled continuously, unlike other XBee products where the output is enabled for a short period of time after each received transmission. If running on the XBIB development board, DIO10 is connected to the RSSI LEDs, which may be interpreted as follows:

| PWM duty cycle | Number of LEDs turned on | Received signal strength (dBm) |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| 79.39% or more | 3 | 83 dBm or higher |
| 62.42% to 79.39% | 2 | -93 to -83 dBm |
| 45.45% to 62.42% | 1 | -103 to -93 dBm |
| Less than 45.45% | 0 | Less than -103 dBm, or no cellular network connection |



### Jumpers

#### Power Jumper

The X1 Jumper connects power from the Shield to the 5V rail on the connected R3/R4 board. Cutting this jumper will disconnect this power path. 

#### ATX/ARX

Cut these jumpers to disconnect the alternate RX/TX pins from your R3/R4 board. 





#### ALED/PLED

If power consumption is an issue, you need to run dark, or if you just don't like the LEDs, cut the respective jumper to sever power to the LED. 

* PLED: Red
* ALED: Blue
* RLED (RSSI): Yellow
* IOLED: Green

#### SHLD

For most applications, the single point grounding of the USB-C connector is sufficient. However, should you run into problems with EMI/EMC, we've provided a jumper that allow you to disconnect the USB Shield from ground.

####I2C 

The I<sup>2</sup>C jumper pulls the SDA and SCL pins to VDD (normally 3.3V) through two 2.2K Ohm resistors. If you have multiple Qwiic devices on the same bus you may want to disable these by opening the jumper (assuming they are also operating at 3.3V logic).

??? tip "Need more measurements?"
	For more information about the board's dimensions, users can download the [Eagle files](../assets/board_files/eagle_files.zip) for the board. These files can be opened in Eagle and additional measurements can be made with the dimensions tool.
